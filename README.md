# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
To perform an audit of tabulated election results in a Colorado-based US Congressional precinct. This consists of mail-in ballots which are hand counted, punch cards which are machine counted and direct recording electronic counting machines which are computer counted. For this particular election we are looking for total votes for each candidate and for each county represented in the data.

#### Summary

This script could be utlized efficiently in any state and with any county  or group of counties as long as we have the data. It would take only minor updates to the code. This is an efficient way to capture the data of all electoral votes and tally the summary for any election. This code could also be modified to give a percentage of voter turnout against the wider population on a city, county or state level.This script could also be expanded and utilized on a national level.
