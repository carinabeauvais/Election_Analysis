# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Tom and I are performing an audit of tabulated election results in a Colorado-based US Congressional precinct. We are looking at mail-in ballots which are hand counted, punch cards which are machine counted and direct recording electronic counting machines which are computer counted. 

1. We are looking for the total votes cast.
2. We also want to know the total votes for each candidate.
3. We want the percentage of votes for each candidate.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Resources
 1. Data source: Election_Results.csv
 2. Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

#### Summary
The results show the following:
* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

* The candidates were as follows:
*   Charles Casper Stockham
*   Diana DeGette
*   Raymon Anthony Doane

* The candidate results were as follows:
*   Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes.
*   Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.
*   Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.

The winner of the election was:
* Diana DeGette with a vote count of 272,892 which was 73.8% of the popular vote.

##### Challenge Overview
Utilizing Python we learned how to write code in Visual Studio Code to quickly tally the results of this election and send the results to a CSV tile. Also learned how to load the results using Git Bash. 

###### Challenge Summary
This challenge showed us how to expand our knowlege of utilizing conditional for loops and if then statements within Python to more efficiently execute code over large sets of data. One of the biggest challenges was making sure to have the parentheses and brackets all closed and understanding how to write the code in a way to yield the proper results.
